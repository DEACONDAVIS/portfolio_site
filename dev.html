        <p>This semester in Web Development, I learned a lot about making websites more interactive and professional using JavaScript. Something that I think I did well this semester was aiming high for my projects. One thing I said I wanted to do was to make a custom database, and I was disappointed that I never figured it out. The other day, when I was coding my web development portfolio, I got the Idea to make a taco counter. I wanted the number to always be the same unless someone clicked the Add a Taco button. In trying to do this, I came across a Google service that helps you with custom databases. I used this service, and even though I only had one piece of data I was saving, I finally made a database (kind of). 
            Something I found hard this semester was understanding variable declarations. Normally, when I make a variable, I don't think I need to tell it if it can change or not. I was able to overcome this by revisiting the W3Schools website, so I could study the topic again and again. Through this class, I learned how to make my websites look and function in a professional manner. This will be important in my life because I could make websites as part of a future career someday. I could've been better prepared for this class if I paid more attention to the JavaScript lessons at the beginning of the semester. 	If I could take this course again, I would really focus on the JavaScript lessons. My most fun assignment this semester was making my final project because, I loved coming up with weird and dumb vacations, and I am a sucker for a really crappy knock-off. The assignment I am most proud of from this semester was my taco counter in my portfolio. I think that it was really satisfying to be able to get input from a user and save it visually on my website. I am grateful to my teacher because he helped me by giving me good feedback and help when I was confused. Overall, I'm glad I took this class.</p>
